## Installation

To run the examples and create the plots, Python 3.13 and `virtualenv` or `uv` is needed.

The necessary packages for installation with `virtualenv` are listed in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).
They can be installed in a virtual environment by, e.g.,

```bash
python3 -m virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or by use of the [`Makefile`](Makefile) with

``` shell
make venv
```

## Running the Experiments

The numerical examples from the paper are provided as `example_*.py` Python scripts. They can also be run with `make` by

``` shell
make figures
```

which will create the virtual environment if necessary.

For usage with `uv` simply run

``` shell
uv run example_polynomial.py
uv run example_rational.py
```
